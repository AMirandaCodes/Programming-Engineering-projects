# Project 3: Applying a Watermark Automatically to Multiple Word Documents

## Project Brief
The company requires a one-off automated solution to apply a custom watermark to multiple Word documents. Moving forward, users will manually apply the watermark to any new documents as needed. 

## Project Requirements
- **Preservation of Content and Format**: The original content and format of the documents must remain unchanged after the watermark is applied.
- **Consistent Watermark**: Only the specified watermark should be applied across all documents.
- **Standard Word Watermark**: The watermark must be implemented using Word's built-in watermark feature (not as a Building Block or alternative approach), ensuring compatibility with Word's native watermark settings.

## Project Deliverables
- A VBA code solution that can:
  1. Open Word files from a specified folder.
  2. Apply the specified watermark to each document.
  3. Save the changes and close the documents automatically.
