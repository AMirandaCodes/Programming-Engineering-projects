# Project 1: Customising a hover card in SharePoint

## Project Brief
The company has SharePoint Online set up and requires a way to quickly preview documents without the need of opening them. This was initially intended for previewing `.msg` emails (as it's the main file type of the intended library), but can be applied to any other library in SharePoint.

## Project Requirements
- **Clear preview of the document**: A clear and legible preview of the document must be shown.
- **Single or no trigger action**: The preview must be presented with minimal user actions required (such as hovering the mouse over the file name or single-clicking)
- **Available in all folders**: This preview function must be available to all folders and documents within the library

## Project Deliverables
- A solution capable of providing a preview of any document in legible size. This could be through a default SharePoint feature or by a programmed feature.
