# Project 1: Customising a Hover Card in SharePoint

## Project Brief
The company uses SharePoint Online and requires an efficient method for quickly previewing documents without opening them. While the primary focus is on previewing `.msg` email files in a specific library, the solution should be adaptable to other file types and applicable across any SharePoint library.

## Project Requirements
- **Clear Document Preview**: The preview must display a clear and legible version of the document for quick review.
- **Minimal User Actions**: The preview should be triggered with minimal effort, such as hovering over the file name or performing a single click.
- **Library-Wide Availability**: The preview functionality must be accessible for all folders and documents within the specified library.

## Project Deliverables
- A working solution that enables:
  1. A user-friendly and visually clear preview for documents.
  2. Consistent functionality across all folders and file types within the targeted SharePoint library.
- The solution may utilise SharePoint's default features (e.g., hover cards, file viewers) or a custom implementation if necessary.
  
## Additional Considerations
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the solution works seamlessly across common web browsers and devices.
- **Performance**: Avoid introducing significant delays or performance issues when accessing the document library.
- **Scalability**: While designed for one library, the solution should be easily replicable for other libraries if needed.
- **Focus on `.msg` Files**: Ensure `.msg` files are prioritised in testing, as they are the primary file type for this project.
